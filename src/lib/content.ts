## What rebates are available for solar in Victoria?

Victorian homeowners installing solar panels can take advantage of several government incentive programs that significantly reduce the upfront cost of going solar.

### 1. Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs)
STCs are a federal government incentive available to all Australians installing solar. The number of certificates you receive depends on your system size and location. In Victoria, a 6.6kW system typically generates around 80–90 STCs, worth approximately $3,000–$4,000 at current prices. Your installer (us) handles the paperwork and applies this as an upfront discount on your quote.

### 2. Solar Homes Program — Solar Panel Rebate
The Victorian Government's Solar Homes Program provides eligible homeowners with a rebate of up to $1,400 for a solar panel system. To be eligible, your household income must be below $210,000 per year and the property must be owner-occupied. The rebate is applied as a point-of-sale discount, so you never need to handle the money yourself.

### 3. Solar Battery Loan
The Solar Homes Program also offers an interest-free loan of up to $8,800 to eligible Victorian households for the purchase and installation of a solar battery. This is in addition to, not instead of, the solar panel rebate.

### 4. Solar for Apartments (2025 Update)
From 2025, apartment residents in Victoria can now access a new shared solar rebate scheme. Body corporates can apply for a rebate of up to $2,800 for shared solar systems installed on apartment buildings.

## How much can I save in total?

For a typical 6.6kW residential solar system in Victoria, the combined value of STCs plus the Solar Homes rebate can reduce your installation cost by $4,000–$5,400 depending on current STC prices.

## How do I apply?

You don't need to do anything. Solar Company handles all rebate applications on your behalf. We'll confirm your eligibility during the free consultation and factor all applicable rebates into your quote so you see a clear, final price.

      "One of the most common questions we get asked. The answer depends on your electricity usage, roof space, and whether you're adding a battery. Here's how to work it out.",
    content: `
## The short answer

For an average Australian home using around 20kWh per day, a 6.6kW solar system (typically 16–18 panels) is the most common recommendation. But your ideal system size depends on several factors.

## Step 1: Check your electricity bill

Look at your quarterly electricity bill and find your daily average consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). In Victoria, the average household uses between 15–25 kWh per day.

## Step 2: Understand how solar generation works

In Melbourne, a 1kW solar system generates approximately 3.5–4 kWh of electricity per day on average across the year. So:

- **3kW system** → ~10–12 kWh/day
- **6.6kW system** → ~23–26 kWh/day  
- **10kW system** → ~35–40 kWh/day

## Step 3: Factor in your goals

Are you trying to eliminate your bill entirely? Add an EV charger? Or just offset the bulk of your usage? This changes the recommended system size significantly.

If you're adding a battery, you may want a slightly larger system to ensure you fill the battery daily and still have excess to export.

## Step 4: Check your roof space

A standard 400W solar panel is approximately 1.7m x 1.1m. A 6.6kW system using 400W panels requires 16–17 panels, needing around 25–30 square metres of usable north-facing roof space.

## The most popular system sizes in Victoria

| System Size | Panels (400W) | Est. Daily Output | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.6kW | 16–17 | 23–26 kWh | Average household |
| 10kW | 25 | 35–40 kWh | Large family or EV |
| 13.3kW | 33 | 46–53 kWh | Large home + battery |

    content: `
## What is the Tesla Powerwall 3?

The Tesla Powerwall 3 is the third generation of Tesla's home battery system, launched in Australia in late 2024. It's a wall-mounted lithium iron phosphate battery with a built-in inverter — meaning you don't need a separate solar inverter, which simplifies installation and reduces cost.

## Key specs

- **Capacity:** 13.5 kWh usable
- **Power output:** 11.5 kW continuous (30 kW peak)
- **Integrated inverter:** Yes (up to 6 strings, 20kW solar input)
- **Backup:** Yes — whole-home or partial backup
- **Monitoring:** Tesla app
- **Warranty:** 10 years (70% capacity retention guarantee)
- **Installed cost in Victoria:** ~$13,000–$16,000 depending on system size

## What's improved over the Powerwall 2?

The Powerwall 3 is a significant upgrade. The integrated inverter eliminates the need for a separate solar inverter, which reduces both cost and complexity. Power output has increased from 5kW to 11.5kW continuous — enough to run an air conditioner, oven, and EV charger simultaneously during a blackout.

## What we like

**Whole-home backup** is the standout feature. Unlike some batteries that only back up a few circuits, the Powerwall 3 can seamlessly take over your entire home when the grid goes down — in milliseconds.

**The Tesla app** is genuinely excellent. You can see real-time solar generation, battery state, grid imports/exports, and set custom charging schedules. It's the most polished battery monitoring experience available.

**No separate inverter needed** means simpler wiring, one less point of failure, and lower overall system cost for new installations.

## What to consider

The Powerwall 3 only works with Tesla's own gateway hardware, which makes it less flexible if you want to change components later. It's also one of the more expensive battery options upfront, though the integrated inverter partially offsets this for new installations.

## Our verdict

If you're installing a new solar system and want the most capable, best-supported home battery on the market — the Powerwall 3 is our top recommendation. If you already have a solar system with an existing inverter, you may get better value from the Sungrow SBR or BYD Battery-Box.

    content: `
## Why commercial solar makes financial sense

For Victorian businesses, solar is one of the highest-return capital investments available. Unlike residential solar where most savings come from self-consumption and feed-in tariffs, commercial systems benefit from high daytime energy usage that aligns perfectly with solar generation hours.

## Typical commercial solar payback in Victoria

For a Victorian business with daytime operations, payback periods are typically:

| System Size | Approx Cost (after incentives) | Annual Savings | Payback Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30kW | ~$25,000 | ~$8,000–$12,000 | 2.5–3.5 years |
| 100kW | ~$75,000 | ~$28,000–$40,000 | 2–3 years |
| 250kW | ~$170,000 | ~$70,000–$100,000 | 1.7–2.5 years |

## Government incentives for businesses

Commercial solar systems above 100kW generate Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) rather than STCs. LGCs have a higher value and are sold annually, providing ongoing income in addition to electricity savings.

Businesses can also claim the solar system as a depreciable asset and may be eligible for instant asset write-off under the ATO's small business tax concessions.

## Factors that affect your ROI

- **Daytime energy usage** — the more electricity you use during daylight hours, the faster the payback
- **Current electricity tariff** — businesses paying above 25c/kWh see faster returns
- **Roof orientation and shade** — north-facing, unshaded roofs produce the most energy
- **System quality** — Tier 1 panels degrade slower, maintaining output for longer
